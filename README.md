# Interim Report
An interim report consists of an outline with a progress update and draft content. The following is a typical interim report structure provided as guidance and this varies depending on the nature of the project. A brief description of each component can be found in the Dissertation section below. Please discuss your interim report with your supervisor before submission.
- Introduction
- Motivation
- Related work
- Description of the work
- Methodology
- Design
- Implementation (if there is any)
- Progress 

**Project management** covering the tasks as a part of your work plan as presented in your final proposal and progress as well as how time and resources are managed. The need for reviewing the tasks and explanation of/reasons for any adjustment made to the future work plan. Inclusion of a Gantt chart is strongly recommended as a visual indicating the progress of the project.

**Contributions** and reflections providing the details of your achievements and contributions up to date as well as a personal reflection on the plan and your experience of the project (a critical appraisal of how the project has been progressing). This section should also explain how you have considered the “bigger picture” within which your work is situated in terms of LSEPI (refer to the Laws, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues in Projects section above), highlighting which issues are the most significant for your project, and how you will address them in the remainder of your project.

**Bibliography** - There is a suggested maximum limit of 5000 words without exceeding 15 pages (A4 sides) for the interim report, including the bibliography and excludes cover/front pages (e.g., abstract, acknowledgment, table of contents).
