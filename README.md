Current goal is to somehow consolodate 4 weeks worth of research like now

- Start the interim report officially
- Write a "technical analysis"
- look at moodle for extra stuff for interim report to look nice
- come up with stuff for the software

# Interim Report
An interim report consists of an outline with a progress update and draft content. The following is a typical interim report structure provided as guidance and this varies depending on the nature of the project. A brief description of each component can be found in the Dissertation section below. Please discuss your interim report with your supervisor before submission.
- Introduction
- Motivation
- Related work
- Description of the work
- Methodology
- Design
- Implementation (if there is any)
- Progress 

### Project management 
Covering the tasks as a part of your work plan as presented in your final proposal and progress as well as how time and resources are managed. The need for reviewing the tasks and explanation of/reasons for any adjustment made to the future work plan. Inclusion of a Gantt chart is strongly recommended as a visual indicating the progress of the project.

### Contributions and Reflections 
Providing the details of your achievements and contributions up to date as well as a personal reflection on the plan and your experience of the project (a critical appraisal of how the project has been progressing). This section should also explain how you have considered the “bigger picture” within which your work is situated in terms of LSEPI (refer to the Laws, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues in Projects section above), highlighting which issues are the most significant for your project, and how you will address them in the remainder of your project.

### Bibliography
There is a suggested maximum limit of 5000 words without exceeding 15 pages (A4 sides) for the interim report, including the bibliography and excludes cover/front pages (e.g., abstract, acknowledgment, table of contents).

### Examples of Good Interim Reports 
The following samples are the main bodies of "good" interim reports selected from various years:
+ [Vehicle Hot Spot Identification on Data Streams, Rebecca Tickle](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9984128/mod_folder/content/0/Timothy_Cargan_interim_report.pdf?forcedownload=1) 
+ [The Swift Instant Messenger, Marcin Wisniowski](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9984128/mod_folder/content/0/Aidan_Reed_Interim_Report.pdf?forcedownload=1)
+ [Impacts of [stuff] on human faces, Humaira Ahmed](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9984128/mod_folder/content/0/Jay_Mehta_interim_report.pdf?forcedownload=1)
+ [Monadic streams library, Chris Purdy](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9984128/mod_folder/content/0/Eskil_Gjerde_interim_report.pdf?forcedownload=1)

## Marking
[Interim RUBRIC 10%](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/9984128/mod_folder/content/0/InterimReportMarkingRubric.pdf?forcedownload=1) 

Considering that the work is in progress, a subset of the relevant dissertation marking criteria (e.g., technical writing skills, appropriateness of the aim and objectives, knowledge on the subject area and topic, critical thinking skills, progress and plan) will be used in the assessment. Evidence should be available of substantial work having taken place, leading to good progress towards the end of the semester against the project plan the students were to have handed in by the deadline. Any reason for being behind plan should be explained through good reflective reasoning (not working hard enough doesn't cut it...)

The rubric provides a set of guidelines outlining the typical requirements of specific grade band for the interim reports. It is not necessary that a project exhibit all the criteria listed in each grade given below to fall within that band. The characteristics of each band are merely representative of that grade. The balance between various aspects of the particular work will be considered during assessment. The supervisor will provide a written feedback justifying the final mark.
